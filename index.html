We decided to focus on how algae affects the coral and what can be done to help retain coral health. <br><br> From Michelle's research, we found that a vacuum-like machine called a 'Supersucker' is used locally to remove overgrown algae from dying reefs to allow the coral to collect sunlight and nutrients, and become healthy again. Using the Xbox Kinect's motion tracking abilities, Jack integrated the Kinect into our project to allow the player to use a Supersucker and use their hands to remove algae which appear around the screen. Our exhibit was designed to be a guided tour, showing the player the state of the reef with the overgrown algae, teaching them about the types of algae and their negative effects on the reef, introducing them to the Supersucker, and letting them clean the reef and see the positive results. <br><br>The exhibit was on display at the Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hilo for the public to experience.
